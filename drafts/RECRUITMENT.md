**Title:** [Testers Needed] Sound Timer - A Simple, Privacy-Focused Timer that Silences Your Phone (Will Test Back!)

**Body:**
Hi everyone,

I'm looking for 20 testers for my new app, **Sound Timer**. It's a simple utility that silences your phone (Ringer, Media, Alarm, Notifications) for a specific duration and automatically restores the volume when the timer ends. Perfect for naps, meetings, or focused work sessions.

**Join the Google Group:** https://groups.google.com/g/sound-timer-testers
**Android Link:** [Link to App on Play Store]
**Web Link:** [Link to Web Page on Play Store]

**How to Test:**
1.  Join the Google Group (this gives you instant access to the test).
2.  Download the app.
3.  Keep it installed for 14 days (just open it once in a while).
4.  Leave a little feedback if you can!

**Promo Codes:**
I have 50 promo codes available to download the paid version for free. DM me or comment below if you need one, or grab one from the sheet: [Link to Promo Codes Sheet]

**I will test back!**
Leave your app link in the comments, and I'll download and keep yours installed too. Let's help each other cross the finish line.
